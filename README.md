The Jaccard Similarity measures the similarity between two sets by comparing the size of their intersection to the size of their union. It is defined by the equation:

Where:
- \( A \) and \( B \) are sets.
- \( |A \cap B| \) denotes the number of elements common to both sets.
- \( |A \cup B| \) denotes the total number of distinct elements in both sets.

This metric is commonly used in data mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing to assess the similarity between documents, sets of keywords, or other data representations.
